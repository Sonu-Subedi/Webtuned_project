# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


This is a practice static website design and isnot responsive.
Techstacks used:
- ReactJS
- SASS
- KeenSlider
- React Router DOM
- PropTypes
- React FA(Font Awesome) icons

Special features:
- Next button added for next slide carousel
- Top scroll icon for a quick way to return to the top without having to continuously scroll or use the scrollbar.
